1.  Problem Statement

   CloudAudit is a HTTP based protocol that allows clients to audit
   metadata relating to security by automated means.

1.1.  Discovery

   Clients can detect support for CloudAudit via a successful HTTP GET
   for /.well-known/cloudaudit

1.2.  Examples

   This section shows a number of examples.

1.2.1.  new section

   preamble to the figure.
   GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/com/example/cloud HTTP/1.1
   As you can see, this figure doodled and dawdled.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.
