Internet-Draft                 CloudAudit                      June 2010


1.  Introduction

   CloudAudit is a HTTP based protocol that allows cloud computing
   clients to audit metadata relating to security by automated means.
   The first release is designed to be as simple as possible so as it
   can be implemented by creating a directory structure and uploading
   files to a standard web server that implements HTTP [RFC2616].
   Subsequent releases may add the ability to write definitions and
   assertions, and to request new assertions be generated (e.g. a
   network scan).  That is, while 1.x versions are read-only, subsequent
   releases may be read-write.

   A client will typically interrogate the service and verify compliance
   with local policy before making use of it.  It may do so by checking
   certain pre-defined parameters (for example, the geographical
   location of the servers, compliance with prevailing security
   standards, etc.) or it may enumerate some/all of the information
   available and present it to an operator for a manual decision.  This
   process may be fully automated, for example when searching for least
   cost services or for an alternative service for failover.

   As it is impossible to tell in advance what information will be of
   interest to clients and what service providers will be willing to
   expose, a safely extensible mechanism has been devised which allows
   any domain name owner to publish both definitions and assertions.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC2616].

   Additionally, the following rules are included from [RFC3986]: URI.


3.  Discovery

3.1.  Repository

   Clients SHOULD detect support for CloudAudit by verifying that a HTTP
   GET or HEAD for the repository root (e.g. /.well-known/cloudaudit) is
   successful (e.g. "200 OK").  Clients MAY also verify that requests
   for invalid URLs (e.g. /.well-known/<random>) return an error (e.g.



Hoff, et al.            Expires December 16, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 CloudAudit                      June 2010


   "404 Not Found").

   If clients do not confirm the existence of a CloudAudit repository
   then they may be susceptible to false negatives (e.g. falsely
   assuming an assertion is absent when in fact the entire repository is
   absent) and if they do not confirm the absence of errors for invalid
   URLs then they may be susceptible to false positives (e.g. falsely
   assuming an assertion is present when in fact any assertion is
   present).

3.2.  Links

   Servers MAY specify the root of a CloudAudit repository in the HTTP
   Link: header and/or HTML LINK element with
   rel="http://cloudaudit.org".  This allows one or more services to
   delgate requests to a single local or remote/third-party server.
   Clients SHOULD check for the presence of these links before assuming
   that there is a local CloudAudit repository.
<link rel="http://cloudaudit.org" href="http://example.com/.well-known/cloudaudit/com.example.ec2">

                              HTML Discovery

Link: <http://example.com/.well-known/cloudaudit/com.example.ec2>; rel="http://cloudaudit.org"

                              HTTP Discovery


4.  Enumeration

   Servers MAY render a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) response to a
   HTTP request for a directory containing an A or LINK element for
   every child with a HREF attribute containing the relative URL of the
   child.  Clients MUST NOT rely on this functionality, which will vary
   from server to server.


5.  Namespaces

   CloudAudit defines two namespaces; the glossary namespace which
   contains definitions and the service namespace which contains
   assertions.  It relies on the Domain Name Service (DNS) to divide the
   glossary and service namespaces in an extensible fashion without
   relying on registries.

   A domain name (e.g. example.com) under the control of the party is
   broken into its components (e.g. example, com), reversed (e.g. com,
   example) and recombined (e.g. com.example).  That party "owns" this
   namespace so long as the domain is registered to them and they may

   subdivide it with components in order to reference and/or categorise
   glossary definitions and service assertions.  These MAY or MAY NOT
   represent valid hosts in the DNS.

   URI schemes and paths are NOT supported (e.g.
   https://example.com/cloud), however it is possible for a service to
   advertise an alternate name (e.g. cloud.example.com) via the HTTP
   Link header and/or HTML LINK element (Section 3).

5.1.  Glossary namespace

   The glossary allows clients to enumerate and/or resolve definitions,
   and to obtain additional documentation.  Servers MUST provide a plain
   text representation and MAY provide alternative representations (such
   as HTML) via HTTP content negotiation.

5.1.1.  Examples

   The following shows client obtaining a definition for org.iso.3166-1.
   < GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/glossary/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1
   < Host: iso.org
   <
   > HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   > Content-Length: 24
   > Content-Type: text/plain
   >
   > ISO 3166-1 Country Codes

5.2.  Service namespace

   Assertions can be made about the local service and/or remote
   service(s).

5.2.1.  Local Assertions

   Local assertions refer to the service(s) sharing the same URL end-
   point as the CloudAudit repository.  They can be identified by the
   absence of a '/-/' component in the URL (which is used as a
   delineator for Remote Assertions Section 5.2.2) and can normally be
   implemented using symbolic links or web server configuration.

5.2.1.1.  Examples

   This example shows a client retrieving the ISO 3166-1 country code(s)
   from which the cloud.example.com service is being provided.

   < GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/service/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1
   < Host: iso.org
   <
   > HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   > Content-Length: 3
   > Content-Type: text/plain
   >
   > US

5.2.2.  Remote Assertions

   There are a number of scenarios where it is necessary to answer
   CloudAudit queries on behalf of others, including:

   o  Responding to queries on behalf of multiple servers

   o  Responding to queries from multiple clients

   o  Proxying in order to supplement or override assertions

   o  Incompatibilities with existing systems and software that prevents
      co-location

   Remote assertions are supported by embedding both the name (e.g.
   cloud.example.com) and the assertion queried (e.g. 3166-1.iso.org) in
   the URL.  The name and assertion MUST be delineated with a '/-/' URL
   component as they may vary in length.

5.2.2.1.  Examples

   This example shows a client retrieving the ISO 3166-1 country code(s)
   from which the cloud.example.com service is being provided, from the
   remote server cloudaudit.net.
< GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/service/com/example/cloud/-/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1
< Host: cloudaudit.net
<
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Length: 3
> Content-Type: text/plain
>
> US

5.2.3.  Third-party Assertions

   It may be necessary for third-parties to make assertions, for example
   where an auditor certifies compliance with a given standard at a
   given time.  This can be achieved either by retrieving a trusted
   representation (for example, an image containing a physical

   signature, or a digitally signed document) from the first-party or by
   being redirected to a third-party and retrieving the assertion
   directly from them.


6.  Digital Signatures

   Digital signatures allow clients to verify the integrity of the
   assertions (both first-party and third-party).


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   The content of CloudAudit repositories MAY NOT be secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised.  Clients
   SHOULD use Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] or equivalent to
   ensure confidentiality and integrity when accessing CloudAudit
   repositories over a public network such as the Internet.

   The Domain Name System (DNS) MAY be susceptible to attacks and care
   should be taken to authenticate servers, for example by verifying the
   chain of trust and infromation contained in SSL certificates
   provided, by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, by
   relying on DNSSEC [RFC4033], etc.

   Malicious clients MAY seek to obtain sensitive information via
   CloudAudit which could then be used to launch an attack.  Such
   information should only be made available to authorised clients who
   have been authenticated via HTTP authentication [RFC2617] or
   equivalent.

   Servers may make false first-party assertions or may refer to third-
   party assertions that do not apply to them, or that expand the scope
   of the intended meaning.  Clients that do not trust servers may
   choose only to rely on trusted third-party assertions, in which case
   the integrity of the assertion SHOULD be verified by transferring it
   over Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] or equivalent or by
   verifying a digital signature applied to the assertion using OpenPGP
   [RFC4880] or equivalent
