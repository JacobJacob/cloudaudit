    <abstract>
      <t>CloudAudit (A6) provides a common interface that allows cloud
      computing providers to automate the Audit, Assertion, Assessment, and
      Assurance (A6) of their infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and
      application (SaaS) environments and allows authorized consumers of their
      services to do likewise via an open, extensible and secure interface and
      methodology.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>CloudAudit is a HTTP based protocol that allows clients to audit
      metadata relating to security by automated means.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>, as scoped to those conformance targets.</t>

      <t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
      <xref target="RFC2616"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref
      target="RFC3986"></xref>: URI.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Namespace">
      <t>CloudAudit relies on the DNS to divide the assertion and glossary
      namespaces in an extensible fashion without registries.</t>

      <t>The DNS name (e.g. cloud.example.com) is broken into its components
      (e.g. cloud, example, com), reversed (e.g. com, example, cloud) and
      recombined to create a path (e.g. com/example/cloud).</t>

      <t>URI schemes and paths are NOT supported (e.g.
      https://example.com/cloud), however it is possible to advertise an
      alternative (e.g. cloud.example.com) via the HTTP Link header and/or
      HTML LINK element (<xref target="discovery"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery">
      <t>Clients MAY detect support for CloudAudit via a successful HTTP GET
      or HEAD for the URL /.well-known/cloudaudit.</t>

      <t>Servers MAY specify a remote CloudAudit service in the HTTP Link:
      header and/or HTML LINK element with rel="cloudaudit".</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Enumeration">
      <t>Servers SHOULD render a valid XML response to a HTTP request for a
      directory, containing an A or LINK element for every child with a HREF
      attribute containing the relative URL of the child. This response MAY be
      HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Clients MUST NOT rely on this
      functionality.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Assertions">
      <t>Assertions can be made about the local service and/or remote
      service(s).</t>

      <section title="Local Assertions">
        <t></t>

        <section title="Examples">
          <t></t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/assert/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1]]></artwork>
          </figure>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Remote Assertions">
        <t>There are a number of scenarios where it is necessary to answer
        CloudAudit queries on behalf of others, including:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Responding to queries on behalf of multiple servers</t>

            <t>Responding to queries from multiple clients</t>

            <t>Proxying in order to supplement or override assertions</t>

            <t>Incompatibilities with existing systems and software that
            prevents co-location</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Remote assertions are supported by embedding both the name (e.g.
        cloud.example.com) and the assertion queried (e.g. 3166-1.iso.org) in
        the URL. The name and assertion MUST be delineated with a '/-/' URL
        component as they may vary in length.</t>

        <section title="Examples">
          <t>This example shows a remote query on behalf of cloud.example.com
          for the 3166-1.iso.org assertion.</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/assert/com/example/cloud/-/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1]]></artwork>
          </figure>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Glossary">
      <t>The glossary allows clients to enumerate or resolve and obtain
      documentation for each assertion type. Servers MUST provide a HTML
      representation and MAY provide alternative representations via HTTP
      content negotiation.</t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>The following shows a query for the 3166-1.iso.org assertion
        type.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/glossary/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Digital Signatures">
      <t>Digital signatures allow clients to verify the integrity of the
      assertions (both first-party and third-party).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
      RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The content of CloudAudit repositories MAY NOT be secure, private or
      integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
      them.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">

      Working Group as well as early adopters.</t>
