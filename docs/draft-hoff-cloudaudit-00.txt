 CloudAudit - Automated Audit, Assertion, Assessment, and Assurance API
                        draft-hoff-cloudaudit-00

Abstract

   CloudAudit (A6) provides a common interface that allows cloud
   computing providers to automate the Audit, Assertion, Assessment, and
   Assurance (A6) of their infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and
   application (SaaS) environments and allows authorized consumers of
   their services to do likewise via an open, extensible and secure
   interface and methodology.

Internet-Draft                 CloudAudit                     March 2010


1.  Introduction

   CloudAudit is a HTTP based protocol that allows clients to audit
   metadata relating to security by automated means.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC2616].

   Additionally, the following rules are included from [RFC3986]: URI.


3.  Namespace

   CloudAudit relies on the DNS to divide the assertion and glossary
   namespaces in an extensible fashion without registries.

   The DNS name (e.g. cloud.example.com) is broken into its components
   (e.g. cloud, example, com), reversed (e.g. com, example, cloud) and
   recombined to create a path (e.g. com/example/cloud).

   URI schemes and paths are NOT supported (e.g.
   https://example.com/cloud), however it is possible to advertise an
   alternative (e.g. cloud.example.com) via the HTTP Link header and/or
   HTML LINK element (Section 4).


4.  Discovery

   Clients MAY detect support for CloudAudit via a successful HTTP GET
   or HEAD for the URL /.well-known/cloudaudit.

   Servers MAY specify a remote CloudAudit service in the HTTP Link:
   header and/or HTML LINK element with rel="cloudaudit".


5.  Enumeration

   Servers SHOULD render a valid XML response to a HTTP request for a
   directory, containing an A or LINK element for every child with a
   HREF attribute containing the relative URL of the child.  This

   response MAY be HyperText Markup Language (HTML).  Clients MUST NOT
   rely on this functionality.


6.  Assertions

   Assertions can be made about the local service and/or remote
   service(s).

6.1.  Local Assertions

6.1.1.  Examples

   GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/assert/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1

6.2.  Remote Assertions

   There are a number of scenarios where it is necessary to answer
   CloudAudit queries on behalf of others, including:

   o  Responding to queries on behalf of multiple servers

   o  Responding to queries from multiple clients

   o  Proxying in order to supplement or override assertions

   o  Incompatibilities with existing systems and software that prevents
      co-location

   Remote assertions are supported by embedding both the name (e.g.
   cloud.example.com) and the assertion queried (e.g. 3166-1.iso.org) in
   the URL.  The name and assertion MUST be delineated with a '/-/' URL
   component as they may vary in length.

6.2.1.  Examples

   This example shows a remote query on behalf of cloud.example.com for
   the 3166-1.iso.org assertion.
GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/assert/com/example/cloud/-/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1


7.  Glossary

   The glossary allows clients to enumerate or resolve and obtain
   documentation for each assertion type.  Servers MUST provide a HTML
   representation and MAY provide alternative representations via HTTP
   content negotiation.

7.1.  Examples

   The following shows a query for the 3166-1.iso.org assertion type.
   GET /.well-known/cloudaudit/1.0/glossary/org/iso/3166-1 HTTP/1.1


8.  Digital Signatures

   Digital signatures allow clients to verify the integrity of the
   assertions (both first-party and third-party).


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


10.  Security Considerations

   The content of CloudAudit repositories MAY NOT be secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
   them.


11.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to acknowledge all members of the CloudAudit
   Working Group as well as early adopters.
